            Alright! So Iâ€™m a 25-year old based in Rotterdam. I'm a
            Communication multimedia design student With a great passion for
            experimenting and working on physical products and installations.
            With my coding background (graduated in Interactive design at
            Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam, 2016), I like to challenge myself to
            tryout techniques such as AR/VR. In september I'm starting the minor
            Smart material for behaviour change. For my graduation project I
            would like to discover more new technology and use them in projects.
            Topics that I would like to work with sound and light combining with
            topics like future living, sustainability, food or music. With the
            goal to inspire, entertain, and educate the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            In In my spare time I try to do small experiments with musical
            instruments or food dishes. Or I might be found on the beach
            catching waves (:
