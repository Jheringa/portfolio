        <p>We had a hard time coming up with a concept. This was because we found out that the problem didn't lie in that people didn't want to come back but the fact that they simply didn't know about the artist that was playing in Paard. The marketing side of Paard was outdated and hard to find.</p>

            <strong>Socialize</strong>
            <p>It is very important for our target group to meet up with their friends. Therefore we want social media to be a part of our concept. A way to invite your friends or meet new people</p>

            <p>To go around this problem we came with the idea to create a concept party. This party would be called "Surprise Paard". In this concept, you pick your genre, pick a date that you're available and invite your friends and will be surprised with a party in that theme. Paard also wanted to be personal with their clients, this is why when you bought a ticket you will receive a personalized Paard card a couple days later on your doorstep. This card is not only your ticket, for people that can't wait you can also scan the card and it will reveal the artist that will play that night!</p>

            <h3 className="h3__case">Final concept</h3>
            <p>We organize a well-arranged party. Itâ€™s up to you to invite your friends (or not) choose a genre and pick a date. We will surprise you with an artist your chosen genre. In that way, you can discover new artists and expand your Spotify list. As a cherry on top, we will send you your special invite card (also your entrance ticket) at home!</p></div>

        <p>My task in this process was to design the one-pager and prototype. To do this It was necessary to create a good flow. To keep everything in the branding of Paard a style guide was also needed.</p>

        <p>This was the first time to work with principle. I chose this program because I wanted to try something else other than adobe XD or Invision. It was a fine program to work with but I missed the ability to easily click through different paths without having to draw it out.</p>
