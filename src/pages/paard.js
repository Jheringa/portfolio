        <p>We had a hard time coming up with a concept. This was because we found out that the problem didn't lie in that people didn't wanted to come back but the fact that they simply didn't knew about the artist that were playing in Paard. The marketing side of Paard was outdated and hard to find.</p>

            <p>To go around this problem we came with the idea to create a concept party. This party would be called "Surprise paard". In this concept you pick your genre, pick a date that you're avalible and invite your friends and will be surprised with a party in that theme. Paard also wanted to be personal with their clients, this is why when you bought a ticket you will recieve a personalized Paard kaart a couple days later on your doorstep. This card is not only your ticket, for people that can't wait you can also scan the card and it will reviel the artist that will play that night!</p>

            <h3 className="h3__case">Final concept</h3>
            <p>We organise a well arranged party. Itâ€™s up to you to invite your friends (or not) choose a genre and pick a date. We will surprise you with an artist your chosen genre. In that way you can discover new artists and expand your spotify list. As a cherry on top we will send you your special invite card (also your entrance ticket) at home! </p></div>

        <p>This was the first time to work with principle. I chose this program because I wanted to try something else other than adobe XD or invision. It was fine program to work with but I missed the abilty to easily click trough differents paths without having to drawing it out.</p>
