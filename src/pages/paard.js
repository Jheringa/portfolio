        <p>
          We had a hard time coming up with a concept. This was because we found
          out that the problem didn't lie in that people didn't want to come
          back but the fact that they simply didn't know about the artist that
          was playing in Paard. The marketing side of Paard was outdated and
          hard to find.

              To go around this problem we came with the idea to create a
              concept party. This party would be called "Surprise Paard". In
              this concept, you pick your genre, pick a date that you're
              available and invite your friends and will be surprised with a
              party in that theme. Paard also wanted to be personal with their
              clients, this is why when you bought a ticket you will receive a
              personalized Paard card a couple days later on your doorstep. This
              card is not only your ticket, for people that can't wait you can
              also scan the card and it will reveal the artist that will play
              that night!

              We organize a well-arranged party. Itâ€™s up to you to invite your
              friends (or not) choose a genre and pick a date. We will surprise
              you with an artist your chosen genre. In that way, you can
              discover new artists and expand your Spotify list. As a cherry on
              top, we will send you your special invite card (also your entrance

          This was the first time to work with principle. I chose this program
          because I wanted to try something else other than adobe XD or
          Invision. It was a fine program to work with but I missed the ability
          to easily click through different paths without having to draw it out.
